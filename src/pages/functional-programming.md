# Functional Programming in JavaScript

> Take a look at the inconsistency of Method names on .net objects. It is Kill() for a process object but Stop() on a serviceController object. Putting the noun first puts people in the mindset that their domain is the high order bit and they pick methodnames optimized for their domain. Putting the Verb first makes it clear that the User Experience is the high order bit and the domain specifics are the low order bit. We want an very high level of verb reuse to provide a consistent, predictable user-experience.
